1. Goal: Provide insight into your collaborative work as a team

  Out team's goal is to creating a Firefox addon that will not just help us reach our target mark in this course, but that will prove to be useful for the general Firefox community of usrs and one that we can list on the FF Addon site with our names on it with pride. To reach our goal, we are commited to utilize the strengths of our members to successfully collaborate on this project. We have decided to focus on how we can involve all 6 members of our group to build our add-on. Thus, we’ve decided on a set of key aspects to help direct our team:
  - Communication
  - Commitment
  - Relevant experience
  - Skill set (eg. technical skill)
  - Work distribution

2. The team’s competencies and constraints

Our team has a mixture of skills and experiences in the computer science field. Some members have stronger coding skills and more familiar with software development process, while other members are more experienced in user experience and interaction design. Our team has people with strengths in system configuration, computer interaction, web programming, database designing, and mobile application. Some of our constraints include time - full time vs part time student, and different course workloads. Other constraints include differences in ability as not everyone has same coding skills, styles, and abilities. However these differences are also a strength of the team as we will be able to focus on working with our individual strengths for the project.

3. Describe your brainstorming meetings
  - When, where (online, phone, physical location) of meetings
  We have a slack group, which we are using for communication. In addition we have had 3 short meetings.
  - Who was there?
  We have had 5 different members at every meeting. Everyone has contributed to the online discussions.
  - Rough meeting minutes/notes.
  In the first meeting we discussed potential add-ons based on team member preferences. We looked at the feasibility of the proposed add-ons in the second meeting and decided on our project in the last meeting.

4. Consider the logistics of  your future meetings:
  - Meet at BA since most of us would be around here
  - Meet in weekdays so we are not creating troubles for people who are commuting

5. Plan your collaboration ahead
  - Which roles will individuals take on?
  We will be using the Scrum process. We will assign the Product Leader, scrum master, developers, QAs (test cases) and intergration in the next meeting based on member strengths and preferences..
  - How will you make decisions?
  Based on member’s preference? respect people’s decision due the their past experience

6. github/git How will you collaborate?
  - Using github for collabration: https://github.com/csc302-2016-spring/Group12
  - Developers work on their own branch for some specific features
  - After thorough tests are performed, merge the changes to master
  - Make sure our product’s functionalities meet all the requirements
  - Pull requests (code changes) need to be reviewed by group members before merging to the master
