1. Goal: Provide insight into your collaborative work as a team

  Our team goals are oriented to utilize the strengths of our members to successfully collaborate on this project. We have decided to focus on how we can involve all 6 members of our group to build our add-on. Thus, we’ve decided on a set of key aspects to help direct our team:
  - Communication
  - Commitment
  - Relevant experience
  - Skill set (eg. technical skill)
  - Work distribution

2. Make sure to describe the team’s competencies and constraints.
  - People have various experiences in computer science field. People who are in computer science specialist may have stronger coding skills, more familiar with software development process.
  - Our team has people with strengths in system configuration, computer interaction, web programming, database designing, and mobile application.
  - Time constraint, full time or part time student, different course workload
  - Ability constraint, not everyone has same coding skills, styles, and abilities.

3. Describe your brainstorming meetings
  - When, where (online, phone, physical location) of meetings
    We have a slack group, which we are using for communication. In addition we have had 3 short meetings.
  - Who was there?
    We have had 5 different members at every meeting. Everyone has contributed to the online discussions.
  - Rough meeting minutes/notes.
    In the first meeting we discussed potential add-ons based on team member preferences. We looked at the feasibility of the proposed add-ons in the second meeting and decided on our project in the last meeting.

4. Consider the logistics of  your future meetings:
  - Meet at BA since most of us would be around here
  - Meet in weekdays so we are not creating troubles for people who are commuting

5. Plan your collaboration ahead
  - Which roles will individuals take on?
    We will be using the Scrum process. We will assign the Product Leader, scrum master, developers, QAs (test cases), some people will do the implementation and deployment in the next meeting based on member strengths and preferences..
  - How will you make decisions?
    Based on member’s preference? respect people’s decision due the their past experience
6. github/git How will you collaborate?
  - Using github for collabration: https://github.com/csc302-2016-spring/Group12
  - Developers work on their own branch for some specific features
  - After thorough tests are performed, merge the changes to master
  - Make sure our product’s functionalities meet all the requirements
  - Pull requests (code changes) need to be reviewed by group members before merging to the master
